# BeautySalonSimulation
Beauty salon simulation with a single hairdresser and with
customers arriving at various times each requiring a different service time. This simulation observces
the behavior of the beauty salon at intervals of time. To simulate
customers arriving a reference-based queue is implemented and to simulate customers
waiting in the beauty salon a circular array-based queue where the size is
equal to the number of chairs available is implemented.
